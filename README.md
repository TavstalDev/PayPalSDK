# PayPalSDK

A C# SDK for interacting with the PayPal API, designed to simplify integration and provide a clear, type-safe interface for common PayPal operations.

## Features

- Create, complete, retrieve, and refund PayPal orders
- Strongly-typed models for PayPal API requests and responses
- Async/await support for all operations
- Sandbox and live environment support
- Extensible and testable architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 or later
- A PayPal developer account ([Sign up here](https://developer.paypal.com/))
- PayPal REST API credentials (Client ID and Secret)
- Knowledge about PayPal REST API

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TavstalDev/PayPalSDK.git
cd PayPalSDK
```

### Configuration

To run the test suite in `PayPalSDK.Tests`, rename the `empty_secrets.json` file to `secrets.json`, then populate it with your PayPal API credentials:

```json
{
  "Currency": "EUR",
  "ClientId": "your-client-id-here",
  "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret-here"
}
```

Make sure the credentials are valid for the PayPal environment you're testing against (Sandbox or Live).

### Examples

This SDK includes an interactive console application for testing PayPal functionality:

- Located in: `PayPalSDK.Examples/Program.cs`
- Run with:  
  ```bash
  dotnet run --project PayPalSDK.Examples
  ```

You can choose from the following examples in the menu:

| Example                 | Description                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CreateOrderExample`    | Demonstrates creating a new PayPal order.  |
| `CompleteOrderExample`  | Captures and completes an existing order.  |
| `GetOrderExample`       | Fetches the details of a specific order.   |
| `RefundOrderExample`    | Demonstrates refunding a captured order.   |

> ðŸ§­ The example runner does not require any HTTP listener or web server â€” it works purely via console interaction using PayPal's REST APIs.

To explore more, check out the code in the [`PayPalSDK.Examples`](./PayPalSDK.Examples) directory.
